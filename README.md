## Landslide Detection using Hyperspectral Imaging and CNN U-Net

This project focuses on detecting landslides from hyperspectral satellite images using a deep learning model based on the U-Net architecture. Hyperspectral imaging captures detailed spectral information for each pixel, allowing the model to differentiate between stable terrain and landslide-prone areas with high accuracy.
